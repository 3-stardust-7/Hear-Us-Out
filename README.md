Project Description
Hear-Us-Out is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens, NGOs, and government authorities for effective resolution of civic issues. Citizens can register complaints related to public services or infrastructure, which are then routed to partnering NGOs for verification, ensuring transparency and legitimacy

The Problem statement
Citizens struggle with reporting and resolving civic issues due to a lack of transparency and accountability. There is no streamlined platform to verify, track, and escalate complaints efficiently. Hear-Us-Out bridges this gap by enabling transparent collaboration between citizens, NGOs, and government authorities for effective issue resolution.

The Solution
Weâ€™re turning the chaos of civic complaints into a smooth, transparent process! Citizens report issues, NGOs verify them, and then the government steps in to fix them â€” all in real-time. No more chasing down authorities or waiting in the dark; Hear-Us-Out keeps everyone in the loop with just a few clicks!
